# Trolli

The Second Place Award winning submission for the Addihacks 2019 Hackathon. 

Trolli allows users to find public transit routes to their preferred destinations and leave comments that let other riders know if there are any delays, disturbances, or route closures along the way. Users leave comments in the form of dings that utilize route, time, and location to keep riders up to date with the most relevant information.

Built using a combination of React, .Net Framework, and T-SQL.
